## New problems I have to face
- Showing off graphs in html
- Tying users to an instance of a board game getting played, and doing it while keeping users data secure
- Making an app for my fiance (the scariest product owner)

## Showcasing the app

Home Page Developer thoughts
---
- Designing a home page can be rough, The original home page actually ended up staying in the final product as the about us page. As the design of it did not feel good enough to be the page you see every time you come onto the app. The current home page actually was being developed to be the game search page but then got slowly revamped to be the true home page.
- As I was getting some user testing done on this page I realized that I had made a huuuge mistake with my home page. I had a search bar that when enter got hit, wouldn't activate. It seems so obvious in hindsight, but that was a fun little quirk of development.

Game Page Developer thoughs
---
- Making this page was stressful. Originally when I was making BGST the database did not handle descriptions in games. This is mainly because I got all of my board game data from a kaggle csv. This csv did not have descriptions. So trying to get descriptions became a new pain. Where do I get them? Well I found a tool that may shock some. Content warning advised.

- This tool helped me get the descriptions for all of the games I needed. It was a surprisingly useful tool but I struggled heavly to get it to work. However, when it did work, it worked amazing. Shoutouts to Andrea Nand for making such an amazing tool. I can tell a lot of work went into it. 
- I am not fully happy with the final design that I chose with this page. Mainly because it still feels empty even though I added the descriptions. (You should have seen how empty this page felt without those descriptions. It was unbearable.) But, at the time it was my best work.
