# BoardGameStatTracker

## Elevator Pitch
The main idea is a way to keep track of all the times I play board games with my fiance. 
I want to know who wins the most for specific games.
I want to be able to pick a random game to play based on a criteria that I specify.
I also want to make it so that you can link other users to a instance of a board game getting played. 
So you can keep other users updated on games you played with them.
